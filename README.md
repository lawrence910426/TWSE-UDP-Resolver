# TWSE-UDP-Resolver

For those operating in IDC/Colo environments, directly consuming UDP packets from the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) can be significantly faster than using APIs like Shioaji to fetch market data. To facilitate this, a library is required to parse and decode these packets efficiently.

Among all packet formats, only **Format 6** is transmitted in real-time. Other formats are delayed by several seconds, making it more practical to use APIs like Shioaji or other alternatives for non-real-time data. This library focuses solely on parsing **Format 6**.

## Usage

```cpp
#include "parser.h"

void handle_packet(const Packet& packet) {
    // Print basic information from the packet
    std::cout << "Received Packet:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Message Length: " << packet.message_length << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Business Type: " << static_cast<int>(packet.business_type) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Format Code: " << static_cast<int>(packet.format_code) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    const int port = 12345;
    Parser parser;
    parser.start_loop(port, handle_packet);
    parser.end_loop();
    return 0;
}
```

## Build

This project uses **CMake** for building. It compiles `parser.h` and `parser.cc` into an object file and links it with `main.cpp` to create the final executable.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

---

## Benchmark Results

In the IDC data center test environment provided by Sinopac, we observed that directly decoding UDP packets was roughly 2,000 microseconds faster than [shioaji](https://sinotrade.github.io/zh_TW/).

In the chart below, the horizontal axis shows Shioajiâ€™s latency minus the UDP packet latency, and the vertical axis indicates the number of occurrences.

## Testing

Navigate to the root directory of this repository and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd test
bash test.sh
```

This script runs the test suite, where `TWSE_mocker.py` sends several example packets to the parser for validation.

### Test Setup

`test.sh` spawns two Docker containers:
1. **Parser Container**: Runs the parser to decode incoming UDP packets.
2. **Mocker Container**: Simulates the TWSE by sending example UDP packets to the parser.

You should see the parser process and handle the packets sent by the mocker during the test.

### Run main parser

Run the main parser with testing mode.
```bash
cd build
./main
```
Run the main parser with multicast mode.
```bash
./main -multicast 224.0.100.100 -iface 192.168.205.30
```
Rebuild if necessary.
```bash
cmake --build .
```
